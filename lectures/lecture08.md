**Learning objectives.** After the lecture you shoud be able to

- Explain and implement different ways of measuring correlation: Pearson's
  correlation, Spearman's correlation, Kendall's $\tau$.

- Decide if correlation is a good metric for your model.

- Measure inter-annotator agreement and draw conclusions for data
  cleaning and for limits of your models.

- Use correlation with human judgment to validate evaluation metrics.

- Ensemble models with uncorrelated predictions.

**Covered topics** and where to find more:

- Covariance and correlation
- Inter-annotator agreement
- Model ensembling [Section 14.2 of PRML]
